## Areas for Improvement

### Priority 1 (Address Soon)

#### 1.1 Missing Tests Coverage
**Issue:** While testing infrastructure exists, actual test coverage may not meet the 80% target in all packages.

**Recommendation:**
- Run `pnpm test:coverage` to identify gaps
- Prioritize testing:
  - Managers (`packages/common/src/managers/__tests__/`)
  - Bot commands (`packages/bot/src/modules/*/commands/__tests__/`)
  - API routes (`packages/api/src/routes/__tests__/`)

**Priority:** P1 (Should do soon)

#### 1.2 Environment File Templates
**Issue:** `.env.example` files exist but some may be out of sync with actual requirements.

**Recommendation:**
- Audit all `.env.example` files
- Ensure they match current environment variable requirements
- Add comments explaining each variable
- Consider using a tool like `dotenv-linter` in CI

**Priority:** P1 (Should do soon)

#### 1.3 Backup Strategy
**Issue:** Backup procedures are documented but not automated.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement automated daily backups (mentioned in ISSUES_TODO.md #4)
- Create backup script and cron job
- Document restore procedures with examples
- Test backup/restore process

**Priority:** P0 (Must do - operational requirement)

### Priority 2 (Nice to Have)

#### 2.1 Dashboard Birthday Management
**Issue:** Birthday management requires bot commands; dashboard UI would improve UX.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement `/dashboard/birthdays/[guildId]` page (already in ISSUES_TODO.md #2)
- Add CRUD operations for birthdays
- Include upcoming birthdays view
- Use existing API endpoints

**Priority:** P0 (Must do - per ISSUES_TODO.md)

#### 2.2 API Documentation UI
**Issue:** OpenAPI spec exists but no interactive documentation UI.

**Recommendation:**
- Swagger UI is mentioned in API_GUIDE.md but may not be deployed
- Verify Swagger UI is accessible at `/api-docs`
- If not, add swagger-ui-express to API package
- Consider adding Redoc as an alternative

**Priority:** P2 (Nice to have)

#### 2.3 Metrics & Observability
**Issue:** Currently using logs only; no metrics or distributed tracing.

**Recommendation:**
- Keep logs-only approach for now (correct for 2GB VPS)
- When resources allow, add:
  - Prometheus metrics endpoint
  - Grafana dashboard
  - Alert manager for critical errors
- Document memory requirements before adding

**Priority:** P2 (Deferred - per NEXT_STEPS.md)

### Priority 3 (Future Enhancements)

#### 3.1 CI/CD Pipeline Enhancements
**Current:** Build, lint, test on PR/push

**Potential additions:**
- Automated Docker image builds and pushes to registry
- Automated deployment to staging environment
- Release automation with semantic versioning
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

**Priority:** P2 (Nice to have)

#### 3.2 Integration Testing
**Current:** Unit tests with mocks

**Potential additions:**
- API integration tests with real database (SQLite)
- End-to-end tests for critical flows
- Discord interaction testing (consider `discord.js-mock`)

**Priority:** P2 (Nice to have)
